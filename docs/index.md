# **Overview**

Welcome to the documentation of Inventory Management System.

# **Inventory Management System (IMS)**

## **1. Introduction**

The **Inventory Management System (IMS)** is designed to streamline and simplify the management of products, sales, and purchases in grocery marts. These businesses are typically operated by a **manager** who supervises a few **salesperson** responsible for day-to-day operations.  

This document outlines the behaviour of the IMS explaining how different users — **manager** and **salesperson** — interact with the system, what functionalities are available to them, and how the system responds to their actions.  
The purpose is to ensure a clear understanding of the **system’s overall functionality**, helping to align its features with both **user needs** and **business goals**.

## **2. Problem Statement**

In many small and medium-sized grocery marts, inventory is still managed **manually** using ledgers, spreadsheets, or informal records. This manual process leads to:  

- Frequent **data inconsistencies** and **human errors**  
- Difficulty in tracking **stock levels** and **product movements**  
- Lack of visibility into **sales and purchase history** 
- Inefficient communication  

As a result, businesses often struggle with **overstocking**, **stockouts**, and **loss of sales opportunities**, impacting both profitability and operational efficiency.

## **3. Proposed Solution**

The **Inventory Management System (IMS)** provides a **centralized digital platform** that automates and simplifies inventory-related processes. It enables both manager and salesperson to manage transactions, view stock details, and generate reports efficiently.

- **Product Management:** Add, update, and view product details  
- **Transaction Management:** Record and track **sales** transactions  
- **Stock Tracking:** Updates on product quantities after each transaction  
- **Data Insights:** View historical data   

### **System Benefits**
- Eliminates manual record-keeping and minimizes human errors  
- Improves visibility of stock movement and sales data  
- Ensures accountability through role-based permissions  
- Enhances operational efficiency and decision-making for business growth

## **Objectives**

The primary objectives of the Inventory Management System are:

- **Efficient Stock Management**  
  To provide a platform where admins can add, update, or delete product information and track stock quantities.
- **Role-Based Control**  
  To ensure that access privileges are granted according to user roles (Admin or employee).
- **Transaction Tracking**  
  To maintain a record of all sales transactions.
- **Improved Visibility**  
  To allow visibility of all the products available, making it easier for the employee to interact with customers.
- **Error Reduction**  
  To minimize manual entry errors and duplication by automating stock updates after each transaction.



## **User Roles and Permissions**

The Inventory Management System (IMS) defines three primary user roles — **Admin**, **Manager**, and **Salesperson** — each with distinct levels of access and responsibility. This role-based access control ensures data integrity, operational efficiency, and accountability within the system.
