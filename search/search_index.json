Administrators will be able to view detailed visualizations of purchase and sales data from the previous month, including interactive graphs and trend summaries.

Future versions will include cost price management to facilitate accurate profit margin analysis. This enhancement will enable the calculation of profit and loss reports, helping administrators understand product-level profitability and make informed pricing decisions. Because both cost and selling prices may change over time, the system will maintain historical pricing records to ensure the accuracy of financial analyses.</p>"},{"location":"fucntional_doc/","title":"Functional Documentation","text":""},{"location":"fucntional_doc/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>This document outlines the functional behavior of the Inventory Management System (IMS) from the end-user\u2019s perspective.
